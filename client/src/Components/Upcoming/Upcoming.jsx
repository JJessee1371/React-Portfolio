                        to good use and earn valuable experience with new concepts and technologies.
                        For my next project, I intend to build a PWA that will assist those who
                        wish to enlist in the U.S. Marine Corps. Having experienced it myself
                        and after a lot of discussion with people from all walks of life in the
                        Corps, this is an excellent opportunity to build a tool that will 
                        better prepare potential recruits for the unique mental and physical 
                        challenges that they face day to day. I am open to any and all who wish 
                        to contribute to this effort. The primary focus will be on the MERN stack
                        so I ask that any who wish to contribute have a basic undestanding of 
                        the associated technologies.
