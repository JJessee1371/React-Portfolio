# React-Portfolio

## Description
I created this webpage with the intent of displaying some of my completed projects and to allow others to explore my skillset. I am very eager to learn more about the world of web development and welcome any opportunity to collaborate
with others on projects of their own or any that I am working on. This site was constructed using React and the 
React-Materize framework and will continue to change as I learn more advanced techniques and incorporate other
technologies into my work.
