        JavaScript both on the front and back end to ensure our routes functioned properly 
        and data was displayed as intended. This was an exciting project to work on and a 
        unique opportunity to use many new technologies to construct something that represents

        application uses the input to create a thorough README with directions for installation,
        testing, and contributing along with other key pieces of information.",

        to enter information about the departments, employees, managers, and employee roles
        within their company. Responses are stored in a database and can then be readily retrieved
        and viewed at their convenience. Initially I struggled integrating MySQL syntax into this
        application, but persistence and practice showed me how impactful it can be when making
        relations between data sets.",

        project after a few months to refactor the code was an eye opening experience proving that with time and practice
