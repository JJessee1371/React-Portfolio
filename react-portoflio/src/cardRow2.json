        "desc": "This command line interface application was built with the difficulties of organizing a business in mind. By means of the inquirer module, the business tracker allows users to enter information about the departments, employees, managers, and employee roles within their company. Responses are stored in a database and can then be readily retrieved and viewed at their convenience. Initially I struggled integrating MySQL syntax into this application, but persistence and practice showed me how impactful it can be when making relations between data sets.",

As my very first project built using JavaScript it was a challenge to bring together the concepts and methods that would be most useful for creating this tool. Returning to this project after a few months to refactor the code was an eye opening experience proving that with time and practice the same goal can be achieved through a wide variety of methods and with much less code that I had originally used.",
